## Summary
FreeUp facilitates the upcycling of free used goods between New Yorkers to make the process as streamlined as possible

## Problem Statement 
How might we facilitate the exchange of free used goods between New Yorkers to keep the sidewalks clean and foster a community

## Problem Background
New Yorkers (i.e., Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, Staten Island). Our survey shows many people in Brooklyn and Manhattan (relative to other areas) are interested in “thrifting” or picking up free items off the sidewalks. According to survey results, people of all ages and income levels are interested in claiming free items.

Customers find it hard to know when goods are being given away (lack of advertising on their commonly used platforms), their location, and time arrangements to pick up said items. This is a problem because the sidewalks of New York are typically littered with many items which are meant for give away. These items are eventually picked up by garbage disposal on a weekly basis, but they are in good enough condition to be used by someone else rather than ending up at the landfill. 

Our survey indicates people want to save money for various reasons, find unique items by thrifting on a budget, and also tap into the resell markets. This in addition with the current climate crisis, calls for a sustainable solution which will ultimately improve by focusing on the customer vs New York sidewalk aesthetic!

## Goals 
By creating a platform which provides users with information on free goods and how to acquire them, New Yorkers will be able to exchange goods quickly and ensure their sidewalks/front porches are clutter free much sooner. It will provide individuals with a guilt free method of getting rid of perfectly fine used goods as someone else will make use of it instead of the goods going directly to the landfill. Furthermore, it will encourage individuals to continue to seek free items from others in their neighborhood and foster a safe and welcoming community vibe which was otherwise difficult to do in the busy city.

## User Stories 
1. As a New Yorker, I want to be able to schedule the acquisition of free used goods, so that I can ensure the items will still be there when I am available to pick them up.

2. As a thrifter, I want to see pictures of free used goods, so that I can quickly determine if an item’s condition, size, and functionality satisfy my needs.

3. As a New Yorker, I want to be sure that the goods are free and safe to take, so that the acquisition process is delightful and enabling.

4. As a New Yorker, I want to know the weather of the area where the used goods are, so that I can dress appropriately.

## Solution 
In order to enable New Yorkers to easily exchange free goods, a database of available free goods will support the findability, acceptance of item condition, and location of items across the city. There is also a need to facilitate pick-up times so users don’t have to worry about losing their item to someone else.

The solution should also foster a community aspect among New Yorkers and exchanging free used goods as opposed to leaving items out on a sidewalk (and sometimes ending up in a landfill). This will enable frequent users to get to know each other and create an association of trust and reliability through the platform.


## Product Success Metrics
*Consider metrics you’d want to measure to consider the product a success. How would we know if we’ve solved the problem? What are the things we’d want to measure?*

- Track the number of successful/unsuccessful pick up times per user, per week
- Track the number of items and total mass diverted from a New York landfill
- Track website analytics (time on website, bounce rate, etc)
Understand how users feel after successfully acquiring/giving away a used good
- Understand the time and location hotspots for the exchange of used goods
